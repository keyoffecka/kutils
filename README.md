# kutils
Useful utilities missing in Kotlin stdlib or in JRE

As for now there is a couple of utilities that make life easier:

1. Some lambda function wrappers

2. Some JRE8 methods exposed for Kotlin

3. Default invocation handler for Java proxies

4. Auto.close block for Kotlin as it was described [here](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/kotlin-needs-try-with-resources/214/#post_2)
